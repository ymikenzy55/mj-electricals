## 💡 Recommendation

**Complete the FAQ page next** - It's 80% done and will provide immediate value. The remaining pages can be updated gradually as needed.

Would you like me to:
1. Provide the complete FAQ page code in one document for you to copy?
2. Focus on updating one of the remaining pages (categories, about, contact)?
3. Create a template file you can use for all remaining pages?
