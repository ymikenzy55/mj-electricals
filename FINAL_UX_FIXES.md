# Final UX Fixes - December 27, 2025

## Issues to Fix:

1. ✅ User dashboard has double navbar (duplicate mobile menu elements)
2. ✅ Admin can't see customer contact info (already fixed in previous update)
3. ✅ FAQ page design - needs proper accordion list
4. ✅ Payment success page shows login button (should show user is logged in)
