## 📋 PHASE 3: REMAINING PAGES - READY

### Pages Needing Update

2. Add search dropdown
3. Add mobile menu
4. Add JavaScript functions

### Quick Implementation

For each page, you need to:

**Step 1:** Replace the navbar section with the one from index.html (lines 10-75)

**Step 2:** Add mobile menu before `</body>` (copy from faq.html or index.html)

**Step 3:** Add JavaScript functions before `</body>`:
- toggleMobileMenu()
- closeMobileMenu()
- toggleNavSearch()
- performNavSearch()
- Click-outside listener
